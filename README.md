# Loan-Approval-Classification-Dataset-Project---Binary

This project focuses on developing a binary classification model to predict loan approval decisions using a synthetic dataset designed to simulate the complexities of real-world financial risk assessments. 

​The dataset comprises various features, both categorical and continuous, capturing essential attributes of loan applicants. Key features include demographic information such as age, gender, and education level, alongside financial indicators like annual income, employment experience, and loan details, including the requested amount and intended purpose. The target variable, "loan_status," indicates the loan approval outcome (1 for approved and 0 for rejected).

​This rich dataset served as the foundation for implementing machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, aimed at accurately predicting loan approval statuses and offering insights into the critical factors that affect lending decisions. Through rigorous exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and model evaluation, I explored the contributing valuable insights into financial risk assessment and enhanced the understanding of the underlying patterns associated with loan approvals.
